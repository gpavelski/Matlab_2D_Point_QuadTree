# Matlab_2D_Point_QuadTree
Here I implemented a Matlab function capable of dynamic defining a grid based on the number of points inside each of the cells.

One example using 1000 points and 6 levels depth allowing 2 points inside each grid cell.

There are still some problems when the number of points is too small (less than 20), but I am working on this.
